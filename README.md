# HeatwaveNowTomorrowProtists
These scripts will be used to analyse the 18S sequencing data from a mesocosm experiment on the effects of a heatwave now and tomorrow. Scripts will be added as soon as they are finalised and the published manuscript will be added upon upload. Raw sequencing data can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB66280.
